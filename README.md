# cplusplus_intro
A brief introduction to C++.

The purpose of this project is to provide a very brief introduction to the C++ programming language. Through a series of stages, fundamental concepts of C++ are illustrated and described.

The project was created as part of an overall introduction to creative coding using [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc), which is based on C++.

## Project walkthrough
Following a brief project walkthrough is given, illustrating the single stages of the introduction to C++. Each step of the walkthrough describes the content of the corresponding project folder.

### 01 - C++ base frame
Illustrating the base frame of every C++ program, concretely the *main()* function. The function features a simple print out of some text to the *standard output stream*. Furthermore the *syntax* of a function in C++ is described.

### 02 - Statements
Describing different statements in C++, such as *declaration* statement, *assignment* statement, *output* statement and *return* statement. Furthermore the terminology of *initialization* and *left-hand side (LHS)* as well as *right-hand side (RHS)* are introduced.

### 03 - Arithmetic operators, void methods and string object
Five different *arithmetic operators*, concretely +, -, *, / and % (modulo) are introduced. Furthermore, a completely new function of type *void*, requiring no return statement, is created and called from within the main function. The new function is called *printTextAndInt* and holds two parameters: A *std::string* object and an *int* variable.

### 04 - More functions and local vs global variables/scope
Functions to *add* and *multiply* two variables of type *int* are created and called from within the *main()* function. Furthermore, the difference between *local* and *global variables* and their accessibility is illustrated.

### 05 - Namespaces and forward declaration
During this step, the concepts of *namespaces* and *forward declaration* within C++ are explained.

### 06 - Header vs implementation file
Within this step, a *header (.h)* file is created in order to complement the single *implementation (.cpp)* file. The difference between function *declaration* and function *definition* is emphasized.

### 07 - More primitive data types, the string object refreshed and the Array collection
Basic *primitive (built-in) data types* are summarized, concretely int, char, float and bool. Furthermore, a brief introduction to *type conversion (type cast)* is provided. The *array* collection and its handling is introduced. Finally, some additional information about the *string* object are given.

### 08 - For-loop, while-loop and array iteration
Functionalities in order to iterate and thus execute source code over and over again are illustrated in form of the *for-loop* and the *while-loop*. Additionally, an example for the *iteration over an array* collection is demonstrated.

### 09 - Branching source code using conditional statements
Using the *if-else statement*, the *switch-statement* as well as the *conditional operator*, different possibilities to branch source code are illustrated, helping the user to react on conditions directly.
